## Why a Campfire?

Lessons emerging from existing collectivist experiments have highlighted the value of cultivating decentralised networks that are large enough to support multiple smaller self-governing groups while still small enough that everyone is connected to everyone else, either directly or via someone they trust.

This combination of networked relationships supporting small-group self-governance aligns with the Panga vision of supporting multiple experiments that each explore how to collectively meet our daily needs. Building on this foundation, we want to cultivate a range of different ways of participating in a network that supports the formation of multiple collectives.

This Campfire is intended to provide a space to immerse in cozy hopepunk conversations that helps us recharge from the pressures of surviving late-stage capitalism. This space is potentially both bigger in scale and smaller in scope than the various other ways we may choose to participate in supporting collective practices. For instance, in addition to participating in the many complementary movements, we may choose to build our relationships and cultivate specific skills within Pods; we may form various Collectives that focus on experimenting with specific aspects of collectivist practices in ways that align with Panga principles; we may meet at Gatherings to weave connections across the Panga network; and we may host Salons as a way to invite people from our broader communities into some of the conversations forming within Panga. Meanwhile, this Campfire provides an asynchronous space for anyone interested in the Panga vision to find that recharging dose of hope to help us better participate in our various self-governing small-group practices, weaving our networked connections, and engaging in our broader communities.

Along the way, we hope that the conversations that emerge around this Campfire ca contribute to shaping the emerging direction of Panga - including the various ways we might experiment with how we support each other to meet our basic needs in ways that contribute to potential better futures for all.
