## Why a Campfire?

Collectivist experiments have highlighted the value of cultivating decentralised networks large enough to support multiple self-governing groups yet small enough that everyone is connected to everyone else, either directly or via someone they trust.

Complementing the continued flourishing of existing networks, Panga is a project seeking to combine networked relationships with small-group self-governance to cultivate multiple place-based experiments in collectively meeting our daily needs. As part of this vision, we are invoking a metaphorical Campfire to gather around and immerse in hopepunk conversations about potential better futures.

Offering an asynchronous dose of hope, this Campfire is intended to help us recharge so that we can better sustain our efforts at engaging in our broader communities, weaving our networked connections, and experimenting with different forms of collectivist practices within small self-governing groups.

Along the way, we hope that the conversations that emerge around this Campfire ca contribute to shaping the emerging direction of Panga - including the various ways we might experiment with how we support each other to meet our basic needs in ways that contribute to potential better futures for all.
